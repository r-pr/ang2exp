# Minimalistic Angular 2 + Express boilerplate

This a simple boilerplate for an app that uses Angular 2 on the front-end and Express on the back-end. 
The number of dependencies is kept at the minimal level, to keep things understandable for a beginner like me.
Angular part is built according to [these instructions](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) and is adapted
to be served by Express server.

##Usage
Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
and start the app:
```
$ npm start
```
